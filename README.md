# ssh-client
Python program to manage ssh profiles for default ssh installed in linux or windows

logic/cli version for GUI app for managing ssh connections, should be able 
to read list of users, add users, delete users, and make outgoing ssh 
connections. Just another way to manage the default ssh install present in *nix
 and now newer versions of windows
 
 The cli version is pieced together more so as a prototype, there will be more structure added for the gui.
